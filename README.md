This game is a re-creation of Frogger. HTML5 canvas engine was supplied. Additions I've added so far are to create Enemy object instances, which then update and walk across the screen.

Currently I am in the process of creating player input events, a collision checker, and automatic addition of new enemy objects (which are currently bugged).
